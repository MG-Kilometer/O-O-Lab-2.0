package EventCalendar;

public class EventPanel {

    /*

event: Event   // the event that this panel displays.
completeButton: JButton  // a button that completes the Event (sets the complete variable to true).  Note, this should only appear on events that implement Completable.
EventPanel should display the data of the Event: name, time, name, duration (if applicable), location (if applicable), and completion status.  You can decide whether to drawStrings in the paintComponent function or to add labels and have them display.
updateUrgency(): void  EventPanel should set its background color according to the Urgency of the Event: red for overdue, yellow for imminent, green for distant.  // Applies only if optional features are being implemented.  Otherwise, there is no Urgency field.
